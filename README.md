# Airline-Sentiment-Analysis-


## Project Overview
Processed **5M+ airline reviews** using **Hadoop and Hive**, improving query efficiency by **50%**. Implemented **sentiment classification with Spark (MLlib, PySpark)**, achieving **88% accuracy**.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle (Airline Sentiment Dataset)
- **Features**:
  - `Sentiment`: Labels tweets as **positive, neutral, or negative**.
  - `Text`: The actual tweet content.
  - `Airline`: The airline associated with the tweet.
  - `Retweet Count`: Measures tweet impact and visibility.
  - `Negative Reason`: Specific reasons for negative sentiment (e.g., delays, poor service).

## Methodology
1. **Big Data Processing**:
   - Used **Hadoop and Apache Hive** to store and query massive datasets.
   - Improved **query performance by 50%** through optimized indexing and partitioning.

2. **Sentiment Classification**:
   - Leveraged **Spark (MLlib, PySpark)** to build an **88% accurate** sentiment classification model.
   - Classified tweets into **positive, neutral, and negative** categories.
   - Identified key sentiment drivers such as **flight delays, poor customer service, and cancellations**.

## Key Findings
- **Negative sentiment dominates** customer feedback, indicating areas for service improvement.
- **Delays and customer service** are the most common causes of dissatisfaction.
- **Negative tweets receive more retweets**, amplifying their public reach and influence.
- Some airlines perform significantly better in customer sentiment, showing service quality variations.

## Conclusion
This project highlights how **big data analytics and sentiment analysis** can be leveraged for **customer feedback analysis** in the airline industry. By identifying key pain points and analyzing sentiment trends, airlines can make data-driven improvements, enhance customer experience, and optimize brand reputation management.
